#Contributing

If you find something broken or if you want to add a new company please **contribute with a pull request**.

## Adding or editing something

### Make sure the following is included: 

* Name; 
* Link to extention or website; 
* Short description (if needed). 

#### Some things to keep in mind:

* The description starts with a `-` dash, text starts with uppercase, ends with a `.` period and fits in a single line; 
* If a tool or app without a free(mium) version please add the 💰 emoji after the `-` dash and before the description;
* Please add new links on the bottom of a category;
* Please add to the applicable category, if you feel a new category needs to be added please explain in commit message;
* Links should be in HTTPS (if possible). 

## Removing something

### Keep this in mind: 
* Only remove something if the link isn't working or if the product isnt active anymore;
* If you do so please explain in commit message. 


Thank you! 🙌
